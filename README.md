This is a simple web-based dice game where two players can roll dice and see who gets the higher number.

How to Play

You will see two players, each with a dice image and a "Roll" button below it.
Click the "Roll Player 1" button to roll the dice for Player 1.
Click the "Roll Player 2" button to roll the dice for Player 2.
After rolling, the game will display the number each player rolled and announce the winner.
The player with the higher number wins the game. If both players roll the same number, it's a draw.
